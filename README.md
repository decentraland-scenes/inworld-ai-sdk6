## Configuration

NOTE: In an attempt to make playing the scene locally PLAYFAB_ENABLED is by default set to false in the Scene and Colyseus making so you can play locally with no external services configure (do not need a PlayFab account to test it out).  To enable playfab follow the instructions below.

### Scene

You may want to configure endpoints for your local environment in the instance where you do not want or need to run Colyseus and login server locally

Found in `src/config.ts` there are variables in the following format so you could have configurations for multiple environments

```
const VARIABLE: Record<string, string> = {
  local: "local value",
  dev: "dev value",
  stg: "staging value",
  prd: "production value",
};
```

`ENV` - The environment for which values are to be used (local,dev,prod,etc.)

`COLYSEUS_ENDPOINT_URL` - Websocker endpoint

## Try it out

#### Run Colyseus (Multiplayer server) (seperate tab)
